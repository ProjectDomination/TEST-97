movetest is a test game created to test a new bullet movement code, creating two variations of bullet movement: gradually accelerating speed and slow decreasing speed with accelerating speed after it stops moving. movetest.gmk has two rooms, where *room1* shows the first variation, and *room0* shows the second variation.

This bullet movement code was used for Rejected Domination: Eternal Equinox (RD-1).
